# 🧠 CTF Writeups

Welcome to the Capture The Flag (CTF) Writeups section of this repository.  
This space is dedicated to documenting solutions, methodologies, and reflections from various CTF challenges I've participated in — for learning, growth, and ethical cybersecurity practice.

## 🛡️ Purpose

- **Demonstrate analytical and practical skills** in real-world cybersecurity problems.
- **Build a reference** of techniques, tools, and creative approaches to common CTF scenarios.
- **Practice responsible disclosure** and avoid publishing any undisclosed or actively exploitable vulnerabilities.

## 🧩 Structure

Each writeup follows this general format:

writeups/
├── [CTF-Name]/
│ ├── README.md # Challenge description and summary
│ ├── challenge_name.py # Exploit, script, or payload
│ └── notes.md # Manual steps, command history, or observations
